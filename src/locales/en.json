Good pruning of shrubs to ensure good ventilation and reduce moisture around plants, which helps reduce the chances of infection.\r\n4. Spray microscopic sulfur to prevent mild whiteness, especially in the early morning or before sunset, while avoiding high heat periods. Micron sulfur can be used at a concentration of 2-2.5 grams per liter of water, taking into account the appropriate prohibition period for each crop.\r\n5. Use vegetable oils to combat fried white, such as (neem oil, tea tree oil, jojoba oil). These oils work to cover fungi and prevent their spread, as they may affect the life cycle of mushrooms and it is better to use these oils at the beginning of symptoms or as a preventive measure.\r\n6. Use recommended fungal pesticides such as pesticides containing the active substance (Spiroxamine 75% Difenoconazole 12%, (azoxystrobin 20%.

Avoid cultivation of citrus fruits along with other types of fruit trees that may be a family of fruit fly insect.\r\n3. Some secondary families of the fly are found to remove them or collect fruits before ripening in order not to be an infection\r\n4. Collect the infected and fallen citrus fruits in bags and get rid of them with burning or deep burial.\r\n5. Stir the soil under the trees is a superficial stirring to expose the virgins to the sun.\r\n6. Use vital enemies, such as some types of parasitic lanes,\r\n7. Launching a large number of sterile maleness after exposing them to raying, so the rivalry of the other male male other male on femininity and its descendants is an doctrine.\r\n8. Tremedlure or protein for monitoring and controlling the insect, with a large number (50 traps/hectare).\r\n9.

Early detection of the injury must be taken to take rapid and effective preventive measures to reduce the spread of mushrooms, which prevents the exacerbation of the infection and its effect on the rest of the plants, which maintains the health of the plant and reduces the risk of repetition of infection in subsequent seasons.\r\n3.
