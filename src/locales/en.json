    "coffee_rust_old_treatments": "There are many ways to prevent the spread of coffee rust. The most effective recommended measures include the following:  \r\r\n\r\n1. Good pruning to allow the opportunity to ventilate and reduce the percentage of moisture.  \r\r\n\r\n2. Remove weak, ancient or already affected plants by other diseases or pests and burn them outside the field.\r\r\n\r\n3.",
    "manage_description": "Scabies disease is one of the most important diseases that affect livestock, as it occupies the list of infectious diseases that affect the farm animals, the most widespread.\nThe disease has a great economic importance, as it leads to intense and rapid decrease in the weight of the affected animal in addition to a severe reduction in the product of the affected animal, especially the production of milk, meat, wool, and lounge, and the disease also affects the human being causing him skin infections accompanied by painful itching.",
    "manage_symptoms": "The disease is characterized by dermatitis accompanied by painful itching with skin scales and hair loss. With a microscopic examination of the leather scraping, the edges of the affected part are scraped using a scalpel until the blood appears from the surface of the skin, then the leather sheets are placed in a test tube added to a few drops of a 10% solution of sodium hydroxide and heats a little, after which the sample is placed in a central expelling device and examined under the microscope to ensure the presence of the dream.",
    "manage_treatments": "1. Not to enter the disease with the disease to the proper herd. \r\r\n\r\n2. Isolating the animals with the disease from the rest of the herd and treating it immediately, and it is not allowed to mix with the rest of the herd, except after ensuring that it is completely recovered from the disease.\r\r\n\r\n3. Sterilize all the covers and tools used by the affected animal.\r\r\n\r\n4. Use spraying or periodic draining of the herd, especially after the hair cutting process.\r\r\n\r\n5. Presenting a good, balanced, and rich in vitamin A, the element of people, zinc, and cipt.\r\r\n\r\n6. In the areas affected by the disease, it is recommended to injected all the animals with a lotion of scabies, which was previously mentioned.",
    "foot_rot_description": "A severe disease affects the tissues between the fingers in the jumpsuit. It is one of the most common causes of lameness in cattle and sheep and can lead to a serious economic loss. As one condition in the herd may be very difficult to treat it. Usually it occurs when the livestock are reserved for a long time in places with wet clay",
    "foot_rot_symptoms": "Symptoms appear on the feet in the images of ulceration and swelling of the affected foot, and its smell becomes unpleasant. No ulcers can be seen at the beginning, but open cracks occur in the skin late, and the wound produces a dirty substance that tends to yellow.",
    "foot_rot_treatments": "1. Maintaining the survival of the injuries clean and draining the infiltration well, taking into account that the barn is free of stool because this is a good prevention to avoid infection.\r\r\n\r\n2. For the treatment of this condition, we use a 4 -inch depth box and are filled with lime hydrates and placed where the cows will be pushed by force to walk at the time of Halabah, and this method helps to avoid developing the disease.\r\r\n\r\n3. The infected animals can be treated by removing mold, saturation of the foot with leisure or 1 % copper sulfate solution. Veterinary doctors have been able to succeed in treating foot mold using sulfa doses.",
